# 👋 Hi there, Im Fyqah

--- 
🎓 Currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics  
💡 I enjoy exploring how data can tell stories and solve real-world problems  

🛠️ On my GitHub, you’ll find:
- University assignments where I applied what I’m learning
- Personal projects I built while experimenting with new tools  
- Small experiments inspired by tutorials, articles, and random curiosity

🌱 Right now, I’m building my skills step by step in data analytics — from wrangling messy data to trying out machine learning models.

### ⚡ A little about me
I like trying things out, breaking them (sometimes), and then fixing them while learning something new. Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking 🥾, sci-fi 👽, and baking 🍪

📫 Feel free to connect or peek at my repos — I’m always open to learning and sharing!
