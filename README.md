##👋 Hi there, Im Fyqah

--
🎓 Currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics  
💡 I enjoy exploring how data can tell stories and solve real-world problems  

🛠️ On my GitHub, you’ll find:
- University assignments where I applied what I’m learning
- Personal projects I built while experimenting with new tools  
- Small experiments inspired by tutorials, articles, and random curiosity

🌱 Right now, I’m building my skills step by step in data analytics — from wrangling messy data to trying out machine learning models.  

⚡ Fun fact: I love turning theory into practice, even if it means breaking things first and fixing them later 😅

📫 Feel free to connect or peek at my repos — I’m always open to learning and sharing!
